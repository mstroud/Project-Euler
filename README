My Project Euler programs are getting scattered around. This project is meant to unify them in one project.

Usage is...

./ProjectEuler #

...where # is the project number to run.

Problem solutions share the following function prototype:

  int PExmain(pe_data_t*);

'pe_data_t' is an extendable data structure that holds (among other things) a
string ('result') where the solution may return its answer. 

The solution functions are indexed using an array of function pointers, 'PE_func_table'.

The answer key is stored in a similarly indexed array of string results, 'PE_answer_table'.

The output result of each solution is checked against the answer key at each run and
"PASS" or "FAIL" status is reported for matches and mis-matches, respectively.

Allow selecting project number via command line argument: DONE
Standarize calling interface for solutions for modularity: DONE
Create collection of functions common to PE projects: TBD
Find a way to time how long projects take to run: TBD
