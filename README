My Project Euler programs are getting scattered around. This project is meant to unify them in one project.

Usage is...

./ProjectEuler #

...where # is the project number to run.

TODO:
Allow selecting project number via command line argument: DONE
Create collection of functions common to PE projects: TBD
Find a way to time how long projects take to run: TBD
